I am an avid League of Legends player and love playing due to the strategic depth, knowledge intensive and high stakes gameplay. The combination of these factors ultimately allow me to become a more well rounded individual as the game promotes thinking outside of the box: a speciality of mine.

I main Galio. His simple yet unarguably useful kit is a perfect match for my style of gameplay - teamwork. Yes, I am always playing for the team and making sacrifies so that my teammates may find advantages.
